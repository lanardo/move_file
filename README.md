# Move File

Given .zipx (files) in a shared drive, 
A Python 3 script .py file that I can run to automate this manual process on Windows desktop as follows: 


1. The file extensions need to be changed from .zipx to .zip and then 

2. unzipped: It unzips in its own nested folder by date. 

3. Extract them and move the files into their corresponding folders. Need to paste them out as follows (with print statements on console, 

A) .txt files with _NCOA in the middle of file name go to NCOA folder

B) .csv files with Errors in middle of file name go into Errors folder

C) .csv files with Corrections in middle of file name go into Corrections folder

D) If there is a folder ending in .ebill, all it's contents .csv & .txt go into eNotify folder

4. Deletes the zip file
